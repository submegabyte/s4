### Woodbury identity

aka Binomial Inverse Theorem

inv(A + U V*) = inv(A) - inv(A) U inv(G) V* inv(A)

where G = I + V* inv(A) U

Reduction 2

Convert ssmGen(Diagonal + Low Rank) to ssmGen(Diagonal)

A is diagonal
A + U V* is DPLR

Diagonal inverse inv(A) is efficiently computable.

Can Woodbury be extended to NPLR?

Let's change the variables

A = V* L V - P Q* is NPLR

where
L = diagonal matrix
P, Q = low rank matrices
V = unitary matrix ------ V* V = V V* = I

A
= V L V* - P Q*
= V A_dplr V*

where A_dplr = L - P_dplr Q_dplr*
from hippo1.txt

inv(A) 
= inv(V A_dplr V*)
= inv(V*) inv(A_dplr) inv(V)
= V inv(A_dplr) V*

which leads to the theorem again.

So the answer is yes.
