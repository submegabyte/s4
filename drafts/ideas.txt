Idea/Reduction 0
A, Ad can always be written diagonal + low rank

Idea 1
Convert the kernel from
time domain (ssmConv)
to frequency domain (ssmGen)
Also Lemma C.2
fft(ssmConv) = ssmGen
ifft(ssmGen) = ssmConv

Idea 2
Woodbury Correction
ssmGen(diagonal + low rank) -> ssmGen(diagonal)

Idea 3
Cauchy Kernel
ssmGen(diagonal) == Cauchy Kernel problem
gives FLOPs complexity
FlOPS = Floating Point Operations
